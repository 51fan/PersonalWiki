## Better Browser Using [Back](./qa.md)

- there are serveral steps to use browser well.

#### Web Browsers

- Choose major browsers: **Firefox**, **Chrome**, **Internet Explorer**, and **Safari**.
- Alaways update your browsers


#### Adjust settings

- 1. Disable third-party cookies.
	- Third-party cookies are tracking identifiers used by advertising networks to track your behavior as you browse from website to website. They are an abomination(憎惡) and serve no legitimate(合法使用的) purpose.
		- Firefox: **Preferences** > **Privacy** > **Accept third-party cookies** > **Never**.
		- Chrome: **Settings** > **Show advanced settings…** > **Content settings** > **Block third-party cookies and site data**.
- 2. Clear cookies on exit.
	- Most browsers keep cookies around much longer than necessary. It is best to configure your browser to delete cookies when you quit the browser.
		- Firefox: **Preferences** > **Privacy** > **Keep until** > **I close Firefox**.
		- Chrome: **Settings** > **Show advanced settings…** > **Content settings** > **Keep local data only until you quit your browser**.
- 3. Disable Flash.
	- Flash is a plug-in from Adobe that has been the cause an endless stream of security problems. We highly recommend that you remove or disable Flash.
		- Firefox: **Add-ons** > **Plugins** > **Flash** > **Never Activate**.
		- Chrome: **Settings** > **Show advanced settings…** > **Content settings** > **Do not run plugins by default**.
- 4. Disable Java.
	- Java also has many security problems and you probably have never used it. Remove or disable it with haste(緊促感).
		- Firefox: **Add-ons** > **Plugins** > **Java** > **Never Activate**.
		- Chrome: **Settings** > **Show advanced settings…** > **Content settings** > **Do not run plugins by default**.

#### Browser extensions

##### Essential extensions

- These are absolutely essential browser extensions that everyone should be using all the time. They are stable, open source, and rarely cause websites to break.

======
- <img src="./better_browser_icon1.png"> [**uBlock**](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) prevents most advertisements and tracking networks. It is similar to Adblock Plus or Disconnect but works better and is much faster.

======
- <img src="./better_browser_icon2.png"> [**HTTPS Everywhere**](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) will automatically switch to secure TLS connections whenever the website supports it. This helps to protect against surveillance of the content of your web browsing, although it does not hide which websites you are visiting (unless you also run [Tor](https://help.riseup.net/en/security/network-security/tor) or a [VPN](https://help.riseup.net/en/vpn)).

======
- <img src="./better_browser_icon3.png"> [**Privacy Badger**](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) dynamically detects attempts to track your browsing behavior and blocks content from these trackers. Privacy Badger is not designed to stop ads, so it is not a replacement for uBlock, but it includes some security features that uBlock does not have.

##### Advanced extensions
