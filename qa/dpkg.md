## How to solve the problem of dpkg sub-process throwing a error in Ubuntu [Back](./qa.md)

- Sometimes, you'll find that there's a error when using apt-get to install library. Like the follow:

```bash
E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
```

#### Useage

- **Image** Class has provided the method *detectSquare*, and print the detected line on the image when giving a boolean value **true**.

```cpp
/* new an instance for Image */
Image img = Image();

/* read the image which is to be detected by giving the path */
img.readImage(imagePath);

/* DEBUG is an marco parameter */
img.detectSquare(DEBUG);

/* show the image */
img.showImage();
```
