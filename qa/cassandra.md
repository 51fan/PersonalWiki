- **Cassandra** is a ideal database used for social network. It combines **Dynamo** of *Amazon* with **BitTable** of *Google*, which is based on Column Family(列簇).
- Some characteristics from:
    - Dynamo:
        - Symmetric(對稱的) P2P framework
            - Without special node(solving the problem of SPOF(單點失效))
        - Distributed Management based on Gossip
        - Store data with distributed hash tables.
            - pluggable partition(可插拔的分區)
