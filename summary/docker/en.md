- [**Chinese**](./zn.md)

### 1. Install
===

- i. Log into your Ubuntu installation as a user with `sudo` privileges.
- ii. Verify that you have `wget` installed.
	- Check
	```bash
$ which wget
```
	- If `wget` isnâ€™t installed, install it after updating your manager:
	```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sdo apt-get install wget
```

- iii. Get the latest Docker package.
	- The system prompts you for your `sudo` password. Then, it downloads and installs Docker and its dependencies.
	```bash
$ wget -q0- https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```
	- **Note1:** If your company is behind a filtering proxy, you may find that the `apt-key` command fails for the Docker repo during installation. To work around this, add the key directly using the following:
	```bash
$ wget -qO- https://get.docker.com/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```
	- **Note2:** Docker currently only supports 64bit platforms.

- iv: Verify `docker` is installed correctly:

	```bash

```
