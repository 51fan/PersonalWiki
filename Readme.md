## About

In order to organize all the knowledges I have learnt, I wrote this wiki for me to revise all the knowledges.

## Start Reading
 * [Programming](./Programming/Programming%20Menu.md)
 * [Algorithmn](./Algorithmn/Algorithmn%20Menu.md)
 * [Thought](./Thought/Thought%20Menu.md)
 * [Database](./Database/Database.md)
 * [Data and Computer Communications](./Communications/Communications.md)
 * [Creativity](./Creativity/Creativity.md)

## Supported
 * Thanks to [July](https://www.github.com/julycoding) for how to build a wiki.
