- Process:
	- 1. A user **fills** in a form and then presses a button to **submit** the information to the server.
	- 2. The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.
	- 3. The server processes the infromation using a programming language for back-end development such as **PHP**, **C#**, **VB.net** or **Java**. Sometimes data is also stored in a **database**.
	- 4. The server creates a new page to send back to the browser so that users can get the feedback of submitting successfully.

### 1. Form Structure

- attribute ```action``` indentifies where to send the information
- attribute ```method``` indentifies how to send the information(get/post)
	- get: get information form the server
	- posetï¼š send information to the server

```html
<form action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php"
method="get">
	<p>This is where the form controls will appear.</p>
</form>
```
