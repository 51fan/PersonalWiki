    - It is important to use an iterative(迭代的) approach to defining requirements since they are often unclear early in a project.
    - A requirements traceability matrix (RTM, 需求追溯模型) is a table that lists requirements, various attributes of each requirement, and the status of the requirements to ensure that all requirements are addressed. <img src="./rtm.png">
