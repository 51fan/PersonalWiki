### 1. Processes

1. Planning schedule management
    - A schedule management plan includes:
        - Project schedule model development
        - The scheduling methodology
        - Level of Accuracy and units of measure
        - Control thresholds(臨界值)
        - Rules of performance measurement
        - Reporting formats
        - Process descriptions
2. Defining activities
    - An **activity** or **task** is an element of work normally found on the work breakdown structure (WBS) that has an expected duration, a cost, and resource requirements
3. Sequencing activities
    - A **dependency** or **relationship** is the sequencing of project activities or tasks.
    - 3 types of dependencies:
        - **Mandatory dependencies(強制性依賴關係)**: inherent(固有的) in the nature of the work being performed on a project, sometimes referred to as hard logic.
        - **Discretionary dependencies(自由依賴關係)**: defined by the project team,  sometimes referred to as soft logic and should be used with care since they may limit later scheduling options.
        - **External dependencies**: involve relationships between project and non-project activities.
4. Estimating activity resources
5. Estimating activity duration
6. Developing the schedule
7. Controlling the schedule

### 2. Activity Lists and Attributes

- An **activity list** is a tabulation(表格) of activities to be included on a project schedule that includes:
    - the activity name
    - an activity identifier or number
    - a brief description of the activity
- **Activity attributes** provide more information such as predecessors(前人), successors(繼承人), logical relationships, leads and lags(落後時間), resource requirements, constraints, imposed(強制的) dates, and assumptions related to the activity.

### 3. Milestones

- A **milestone** is a significant event that normally has no duration.

### 4. Network Diagrams

- A **network diagram** is a schematic(圖解的) display of the logical relationships among, or sequencing of, project activities.
