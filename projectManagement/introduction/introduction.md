### Importance of project management

- A 1995 Standish Group study (CHAOS) found that only 16.2% of IT projects were successful in meeting scope, time, and cost goals; over 31% of IT projects were canceled before completion.
- A PricewaterhouseCoopers study found that overall half of all projects fail and only 2.5% of corporations consistently meet their targets for scope, time, and cost goals for all types of project.
