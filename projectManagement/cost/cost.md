## Project Cost Management	[Back](./../projectManagement.md)

-  **Overrun** is the additional percentage or dollar amount by which actual costs exceed estimates.
- **Project cost management** includes the processes required to ensure that the project is completed within an approved budget.

### 1. Processes

<img src="./processes.png">

1. Planning cost management
    - To use expert judgment, analytical techniques, and meetings to develop the cost management plan.
2. Estimating costs <img src="./cost_estimate.png"> <img src="./software_development_estimate.png">
    - Types:
        - **Rough Order of Magnitude(ROM)**: often **3~5 years** before.
        - **Budgetary**: often **1~2 years** before.
        - **Definitive**: often less than **1 year**.
    - Tools:
        - **Analogous** or **top-down estimates**: use the actual cost of a previous, similar project as the basis for estimating the cost of the current project.
        - **Bottom-up estimates**: involve estimating individual work items or activities and summing them to get a project total.
        - **Parametric modeling(參數化建模)** uses project characteristics (parameters) in a mathematical model to estimate project costs. 
3. Determining the budget
    - Cost budgeting involves allocating the project cost estimate to individual work items over time.
    - The **WBS** is a required input to the cost budgeting process since it defines the work items to produce a **cost baseline**. <img src="./cost_baseline.png">
4. Controlling costs

### 2. Basic Principles of Cost Management

- **Profits** are revenues(收入) minus expenditures(支出).
- **Profit margin(利润率)** is the ratio of revenues to profits.
- **Life cycle costing** considers the total cost of ownership, or development plus support costs, for a project.
- **Cash flow analysis** determines the estimated annual costs and benefits for a project and the resulting annual cash flow.
- **Learning curve theory** states that when many items are produced repetitively, the unit cost of those items decreases in a regular pattern as more units are produced.
- Reserves are dollars included in a cost estimate to mitigate(降低) cost risk by allowing for future situations that are difficult to predict.
    - **Contingency(偶然性) reserves** allow for future situations that may be partially planned for (sometimes called **known unknowns**) and are included in the project cost baseline.
    - **Management reserves** allow for future situations that are unpredictable (sometimes called **unknown unknowns**).

### 3. Definitions

- **Tangible(有形的) costs** or benefits are those costs or benefits that an organization can easily measure in dollars.
- **Intangible costs** or benefits are costs or benefits that are difficult to measure in monetary(貨幣的) terms.


- **Direct costs** are costs that can be directly related to producing the products and services of the project.
- **Indirect costs** are costs that are not directly related to the products or services of the project, but are indirectly related to performing the project.

### 4. Measured Values

- **Earned Value Management(EVM)** is a project performance measurement technique that integrates scope, time, and cost data.
- **Planned value(PV)**, formerly called the budgeted cost of work scheduled(BCWS), also called the budget, is that portion of the approved total cost estimate planned to be spent on an activity during a given period.
- **Actual cost(AC)**, formerly called actual cost of work performed(ACWP), is the total of direct and indirect costs incurred in accomplishing work on an activity during a given period.
- **Earned value(EV)**, formerly called the budgeted cost of work performed(BCWP), is an estimate of the value of the physical work actually completed.


- **Sunk cost(沉沒成本)** is money that has been spent in the past. (When deciding what projects to invest in or continue, you should not include sunk costs)
