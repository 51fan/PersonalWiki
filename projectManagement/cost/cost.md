## Project Cost Management	[Back](./../projectManagement.md)

-  **Overrun** is the additional percentage or dollar amount by which actual costs exceed estimates.
- **Project cost management** includes the processes required to ensure that the project is completed within an approved budget.

### 2. Basic Principles of Cost Management

- **Profits** are revenues(收入) minus expenditures(支出).
- **Profit margin(利润率)** is the ratio of revenues to profits.
- **Life cycle costing** considers the total cost of ownership, or development plus support costs, for a project.
- **Cash flow analysis** determines the estimated annual costs and benefits for a project and the resulting annual cash flow.
- **Learning curve theory** states that when many items are produced repetitively, the unit cost of those items decreases in a regular pattern as more units are produced.
- Reserves are dollars included in a cost estimate to mitigate(降低) cost risk by allowing for future situations that are difficult to predict.
    - **Contingency(偶然性) reserves** allow for future situations that may be partially planned for (sometimes called **known unknowns**) and are included in the project cost baseline.
    - **Management reserves** allow for future situations that are unpredictable (sometimes called **unknown unknowns**).

### 3. Definitions

- **Tangible(有形的) costs** or benefits are those costs or benefits that an organization can easily measure in dollars.
- **Intangible costs** or benefits are costs or benefits that are difficult to measure in monetary(貨幣的) terms.


- **Direct costs** are costs that can be directly related to producing the products and services of the project.
- **Indirect costs** are costs that are not directly related to the products or services of the project, but are indirectly related to performing the project.


- **Sunk cost(沉沒成本)** is money that has been spent in the past. (When deciding what projects to invest in or continue, you should not include sunk costs)
