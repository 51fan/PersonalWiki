### 3. Methodology

- a **methodology**: to describe how things should be done
- a **standard**: to describe what should be done
- **PRINCE2**, **Agile**, **RUP** and **Six Sigma** provide different project management methodologies.
    - **PRINCE2**: defines 45 separate sub-processes and organizes these into 8 process groups as follows:
        - Starting up a project
        - Planning
        - Initiating a project
        - Directing a project
        - Controlling a project
        - Managing product delivery
        - Managing stage boundaries
        - Closing a project
    - **Rational Unified Process(RUP)**:
        - Business Modelling
        - Requirements
        - Analysis & Design
        - Implementation
        - Test
        - Deployment
