<img src="./methodology.png">

- a **methodology**: to describe how things should be done
- a **standard**: to describe what should be done
- **PRINCE2**, **Agile**, **RUP** and **Six Sigma** provide different project management methodologies.
    - **PRINCE2**: defines 45 separate sub-processes and organizes these into 8 process groups as follows:
        - Starting up a project
        - Planning
        - Initiating a project
        - Directing a project
        - Controlling a project
        - Managing product delivery
        - Managing stage boundaries
        - Closing a project
    - **Rational Unified Process(RUP)**:
        - Business Modelling
        - Requirements
        - Analysis & Design
        - Implementation
        - Test
        - Deployment

### 4. Business Case(商業論證)

- a **business case** is to capture the reasoning for initiating a project or task. It should include information as follow:
    - Introduction/background
    - Business objective
    - Current situation and problem/opportunity statement
    - Critical assumptions and constraints
    - Analysis of options and recommendation
    - Preliminary(初步的) project requirements
    - Budget estimate and financial analysis
    - Schedule estimate
    - Potential risks
    - Exhibits

### 5. Scrume Documenting

- roles:
    - **Product Owner**
    - **ScrumMaster(PM)**
    - **Scrum Team or Develoment Team**
- artifacts
    - **Product Backlog**: a list of features prioritized by business value. <img src="./product_backlog.png">
    - **Sprint Backlog**: the highest-priority items from the product backlog to be completed within a sprint. <img src="./sprint_backlog.png">
    - **Burndown Chart(竣工情況圖)**: a chart to show the work situation within in a sprint on a day-by-day basis. <img src="./burndown_chart.jpg">
