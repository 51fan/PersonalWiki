### 1. True/False

#### True

- Until the 1980s, project management primarily focused on providing schedule and resource data to top management in the military, computer, and construction industries.
- Every project should have a well-defined objective.
- Projects should be developed in increments.
- Resources in a project should be used effectively because they are limited.
- One of the main reasons why project management is challenging is because of the factor of uncertainty.
- A project’s stakeholders consist of its customers, users, and suppliers.

#### False

- A difference between operations and projects is that operations end when their objectives have been reached, whereas projects do not. (*<strong>wrong reason</strong>: projects also end when objectives have been reached*)
- A project manager's primary role is to provide the funding for a project. (*<strong>wrong reason</strong>: it's the project sponsors to provide*)
- Questions about how a team will track schedule performance is related to a project's scope. (*<strong>wrong reason</strong>: it's the project's time*)
- In order to be realistic, a project manager should always set discrete(互不相連的) goals instead of a range of objectives. (*<strong>wrong reason</strong>: projects involve uncertainty and limited resources. Thus they rarely finish according to their original scope, time, and cost goals.*)
- Managing the triple constraint primarily involves making trade-offs between resources and quality. (*<strong>wrong reason</strong>: should be between scope, time and cost*)
- The only responsibility of a project manager is to meet the specific scope, time, and cost goals of a project. (*<strong>wrong reason</strong>: he/she should also facilitate(促进) the entire process to meet the needs and expectations of stakeholders*)
- Opponents of a project do not belong to the category of stakeholders. (*<strong>wrong reason</strong>: stakeholders are the people involved in or affected by project activities, and include the project sponsor, project team, support staff, customers, users, suppliers, and even opponents of a project*)
