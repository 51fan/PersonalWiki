### 1. True/False

#### True

- Until the 1980s, project management primarily focused on providing schedule and resource data to top management in the military, computer, and construction industries.
- 

#### False

- A difference between operations and projects is that operations end when their objectives have been reached, whereas projects do not. (*wrong reason: projects also end when objectives have been reached*)
