### 1. True/False

#### True

- Until the 1980s, project management primarily focused on providing schedule and resource data to top management in the military, computer, and construction industries.
- Every project should have a well-defined objective.
- Projects should be developed in increments.
- Resources in a project should be used effectively because they are limited.
- One of the main reasons why project management is challenging is because of the factor of uncertainty.
- 

#### False

- A difference between operations and projects is that operations end when their objectives have been reached, whereas projects do not. (*wrong reason: projects also end when objectives have been reached*)
- A project manager's primary role is to provide the funding for a project. (*wrong reason: it's the project sponsors to provide*)
- Questions about how a team will track schedule performance is related to a project's scope. (*wrong reason: it's the project's time*)
- In order to be realistic, a project manager should always set discrete(互不相連的) goals instead of a range of objectives.
