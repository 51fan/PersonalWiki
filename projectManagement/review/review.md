> *<strong>wrong reason</strong>: the next step should be estimating activity resources*

- Milestones are easy to achieve and are always achieved through one main activity.

- A drawback of the precedence diagramming method is that it cannot be used unless dummy(假的) activities are employed.

> *<strong>wrong reason</strong>: using this method avoids the need to use dummy activities is an advantage*

- In project time management, one should control the scheule before estimating the duration for each activity.

> *<strong>wrong reason</strong>: before one can estimate the duration for each activity, one must have a good idea of the quantity and type of resources*

- In a Gantt chart, thick black bars represent milestones achieved in a project.
